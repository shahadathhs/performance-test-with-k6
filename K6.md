# k6 Load Testing Basics

This document explains the fundamental concepts in k6 load testing, along with common output metrics and interpretations for high or low values.

## 1. Virtual Users (VUs)
- **Definition**: Virtual Users (VUs) simulate real users interacting with the application by running scripts that emulate actions such as making requests, waiting for responses, and performing tasks.
- **Configuration**: The number of VUs defines the concurrent load on the system.
- **Output Reference**:
  - **`vus`**: Shows the number of active VUs throughout the test, often graphed to show VU changes over time.
  - **`vus_max`**: Indicates the maximum number of VUs reached.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **High VU Count**: Implies a higher load, useful for stress testing. If your system handles high VU counts without degradation in performance, it suggests good scalability.
  - **Low VU Count**: Used in baseline or smoke tests to verify basic application functionality with minimal load.

## 2. Request
- **Definition**: A request is an HTTP call made by a VU to the server, representing how users interact with the application.
- **Details**: Each request can specify HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST), headers, and payload data.
- **Output Reference**:
  - **`http_reqs`**: Total number of requests sent during the test, indicating demand placed on the server.
  - **`http_req_duration`**: Average duration of each request, showing the time taken for a full request-response cycle.
  - **`http_req_failed`**: Number or percentage of failed requests, signaling potential issues.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **High Request Count**: Indicates that the application can handle large volumes of requests; however, if accompanied by high error rates, it may signal instability under load.
  - **Low Request Count**: Indicates light load or short tests. If low counts accompany high failure rates, it may indicate problems at low loads.
  - **High `http_req_duration`**: Suggests slow response times, indicating a performance bottleneck or server overload.
  - **High `http_req_failed`**: Indicates issues with reliability or server errors, often related to improper configuration or capacity constraints.

## 3. Latency
- **Definition**: Latency measures the time taken for a request to reach the server and for the first byte of the response to arrive back, also called time-to-first-byte (TTFB).
- **Output Reference**:
  - **`http_req_waiting`**: Latency time, showing the server’s response time before sending the first byte.
  - **`http_req_connecting`**: Time taken to establish a connection, useful for understanding network delays.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **High Latency**: Indicates network or server delays; may suggest server overload, resource bottlenecks, or suboptimal network paths.
  - **Low Latency**: Indicates a highly responsive server; generally desirable but can also signify a light load.

## 4. Throughput
- **Definition**: Throughput is the amount of data processed by the server per unit of time, often measured in requests per second (RPS). It reflects the system's ability to handle concurrent load.
- **Output Reference**:
  - **`iteration_duration`**: Duration of each iteration, helping calculate average throughput across VUs.
  - **`http_reqs` per second**: Used to assess requests per second (RPS), often labeled as "Throughput."
- **Interpretation**:
  - **High Throughput**: Indicates high processing capacity and good performance under load; however, if accompanied by high latency, it may point to an overloaded system.
  - **Low Throughput**: Could indicate limited server capacity, throttling, or bottlenecks. It’s generally acceptable in low-load tests but can be a concern under stress conditions.

## 5. Iterations
- **Definition**: An iteration is a complete execution of the test script by a VU. Each VU can perform multiple iterations based on test duration or iteration count settings.
- **Output Reference**:
  - **`iterations`**: Total number of completed iterations, reflecting the total test cycles performed.
  - **`iteration_duration`**: Duration of each iteration, helping identify slow or time-consuming areas in the test.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **High Iteration Count**: Implies that VUs can complete multiple cycles quickly, indicating efficient execution under load. However, if iteration times are high, it might indicate an overextended load or insufficient resources.
  - **Low Iteration Count**: Could signal long-running operations or bottlenecks in the script, possibly resulting in fewer completed cycles under heavier loads.
